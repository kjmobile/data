Is It Hard to Learn Python?
Python is considered one of the easiest programming languages to learn. However, that doesn't mean that it's easy! While anyone can learn Python programming — even if you've never written a line of code before — you should expect that it will take time, and you should expect moments of frustration.
Do I Need to be Good at Math to Learn Python?
Nope! While the conventional wisdom has long been that having natural talent for mathematics makes learning programming easier, a recent study suggests that's not the case. In fact, if you've learned a foreign language, you might actually find it easier to learn Python than a "math person"!
As we've said, though, anyone can learn Python. We've seen learners with a wide variety of backgrounds worth through our courses and succeed, so don't let your own background stop you from giving Python a try!
Should I Learn Python 2 or Python 3?
You should learn Python 3. While some outdated learning resources still teach Python 2, this version of the language is no longer supported, and security vulnerabilities will not be patched.
You should learn the most up-to-date version of Python, which is Python 3.
